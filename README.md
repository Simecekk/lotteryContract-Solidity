# Lottery solidity smart contract

This project is just for my learning purposes but feel free to open any issues

Smart contract is based on https://www.udemy.com/course/master-ethereum-and-solidity-programming-with-real-world-apps/.

I decided to use hardhat instead of remix + created test cases for the smart contract

# Deployment
1) run the hadhat local network: ```console npx hardhat node```
2) run deployment script: ```console npx hardhat run --network localhost scripts/deploy.js```

# Running tests
1) run: ```console npx hardhat test```
